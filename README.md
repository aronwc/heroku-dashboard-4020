This repository houses the source code for Court Watch NOLA's internal-facing data dashboard; it is the product of a year long, service learning computer science capstone project of four Tulane undergraduates.

### Court Watch NOLA ###

[Court Watch NOLA](https://www.courtwatchnola.org/) (CWN) is a non-profit organization located in New Orleans, Louisiana that is "dedicated to promoting transparency, equity, and justice through tracking, observing, and reporting thousands of criminal court cases a year." CWN sends well-trained observers into court sessions of all three Orleans Parish court systems (Magistrate, Criminal District Court, and Municipal). These observers fill out court-specific surveys, which are then uploaded to a popular survey data collection website. 

### Our Contribution ###

Previously, CWN relied on the limited functionality of the aforementioned survey data website, and they often had to manually generate many of the statistics and charts used in their yearly report. For our capstone project, we have created an internal-facing data dashboard which allows CWN to efficiently query their data and create customizable visualizations.
